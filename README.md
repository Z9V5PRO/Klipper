# Z9V5 Pro ( ZM3E4 v2.1)

Here, only the contents of installing Klipper on the above printer are included.

Also, the details may be different, so please install it with more interest.

Almost does the desired operation.

It became a printer with more possibilities.

I am also a beginner, 

so if there is a problem during installation, please solve it by yourself.

Good ideas are shared.

Thank You!!
